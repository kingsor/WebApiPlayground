# TestContainers Demo

This is the project described in [Getting started with Testcontainers for .NET](https://testcontainers.com/guides/getting-started-with-testcontainers-for-dotnet/).

I've discovered [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) a couple days ago and I found it awesome.

> Testcontainers is an open source library for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.

So I started playing with it.

Next step: [Testing an ASP.NET Core web app](https://testcontainers.com/guides/testing-an-aspnet-core-web-app/).
